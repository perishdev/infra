# Provider: GCP (TEMPLATE — not active)

> **Status: TEMPLATE. No GCP resources are managed by this repo today.**
>
> GCP is **not** a managed provider. There is no `terraform/gcp/` leaf, no `gcp` HCP
> workspace, and no GCP entry in the [locked-decisions table](../../../../CLAUDE.md). Adopting
> GCP is a **design decision that must be made first** — per `CLAUDE.md`, update the
> decisions table and [`terraform/README.md`](../../../../terraform/README.md) **before** any
> code or provisioning. This file is the forward-looking template for *when* that day
> comes, written in the same agent-first shape as the live providers.

## Prerequisite: make the decision (HUMAN + docs)

`gcp-decision` in [`setup.steps.yaml`](steps.yaml) stays **red** until GCP is
intentionally adopted (`test -d terraform/gcp`). Before writing anything:

1. Add a row to `CLAUDE.md`'s locked-decisions table (what GCP is for, auth method, state).
2. Note the new leaf in `terraform/README.md`.
3. Then, and only then, follow the phases below.

## Recommended auth: Workload Identity Federation (keyless)

Prefer **WIF** over a downloaded service-account JSON key. WIF lets HCP present a
short-lived OIDC token that GCP exchanges for temporary credentials — **no long-lived key
to store, paste, or rotate.** A service-account key is the fallback only if WIF can't be
arranged; it would live as a sensitive HCP var exactly like the Cloudflare token, with all
the rotation burden that implies.

## The actor split (projected)

| Action | Actor | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Create GCP project, link billing | **HUMAN** | Billing consent is browser + payment; irreducibly human. |
| Enable APIs, create SA / WIF pool | **AGENT** | `gcloud` / GCP API, once auth exists. |
| Approve the WIF trust / OAuth consent | **HUMAN** | One browser consent for the federation trust. |
| Paste SA key into HCP *(only if not using WIF)* | **HUMAN** | Agent must never see the key. |
| Create the `gcp` HCP workspace | **AGENT** | HCP API (same as Phase 1). |
| First `plan` | **AGENT** | Speculative run in HCP. |

## Phases (projected)

### HUMAN — project + billing
1. Create a GCP project (`gcloud projects create <id>` is possible, but billing linkage
   and the initial org/consent are browser steps). Note the **project ID**.
2. Link a billing account (browser).

### AGENT — enable APIs + set up auth
```sh
gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID>
gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com iam.googleapis.com <needed-apis>

# WIF (preferred): create a workload identity pool + provider trusting HCP's OIDC issuer,
# and a service account with least-privilege roles that HCP may impersonate.
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools create hcp-pool --location=global ...
```
Exact WIF config depends on how HCP is configured to emit OIDC; capture it in this file
when implemented. Provider block goes in `terraform/gcp/providers.tf`, using
`google`/`google-beta`, with impersonation rather than a key file.

### AGENT — HCP workspace
Create a `gcp` workspace (working dir `terraform/gcp`, path filter `terraform/gcp/**`,
remote execution, auto-apply **off**) exactly like Phase 1. If using a SA key instead of
WIF, that's where the sensitive var lives.

### AGENT — first plan
```sh
cd terraform/gcp && terraform init && terraform plan
```

## Migrating existing GCP resources

Same pattern as every other provider: **import, don't recreate**. GCP resources are
adopted with Terraform 1.5+ `import` blocks and either handwritten HCL or
`terraform plan -generate-config-out`. There is no first-party equivalent to
`cf-terraforming`; `gcloud ... list` + import blocks is the path. See
[`migration.md`](./migration.md#gcp).

## Leaf skeleton (for when it lands)

```
terraform/gcp/
  versions.tf     # required_providers { google }, cloud { organization=perishdev, workspaces{name="gcp"} }
  providers.tf    # google provider, WIF impersonation (no key file)
  main.tf         # project-level locals (project_id, region — non-secret, like cloudflare/main.tf)
  *.tf            # one file per resource concern
```

Nothing here ships until the decision is recorded. YAGNI — the repo deliberately carries
no provider it doesn't use.
